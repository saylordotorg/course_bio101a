This introductory course in biology starts at the microscopic level,
with molecules and cells. Before we get into the specifics of cell
structure and behavior, however, let’s take a cursory glance at the
field of biology more generally. Though biology as we know it today is a
relatively new field, we have been studying living things since the
beginning of recorded history. The invention of the microscope was the
turning point in the history of biology; it paved the way for scientists
to discover bacteria and other tiny organisms and ultimately led to the
modern cell theory of biology. You will notice that, unlike the core
program courses you took in chemistry and physics, introductory biology
does not have many mathematical “laws” and “rules” and does not require
much math. Instead, you will learn a great number of new terms and
concepts that will help you describe life at the smallest level. Over
the course of this semester, you will recognize the ways in which the
tiniest of molecules are involved in the way we go about our everyday
lives. Note that this course is an alternative to
[BIO101B](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio101b/), and that you may
choose to take either BIO101A or BIO101B in order to learn about
molecular and cellular biology. These courses cover the same material
but in a slightly different way.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:  

-   describe in general terms how life began on Earth;
-   identify early scientists that played important roles in furthering
    our understanding of cellular life;
-   describe the characteristics that define life;
-   list the inorganic and organic molecules that are necessary for
    life;
-   list the structure and function of organelles in animal and plant
    cells;
-   list the similarities and differences between animal and plant
    cells;
-   describe the reactions in photosynthesis;
-   explain how the different photosynthetic reactions are found in
    different parts of the chloroplast;
-   describe the sequence of photosynthetic reactions;
-   explain the use of products and the synthesis of reactants in
    photosynthesis;
-   explain how protein is synthesized in eukaryotic cells;
-   describe the similarities and differences between photosynthesis and
    aerobic respiration;
-   list the reactions in aerobic respiration;
-   explain the use of products and the synthesis of reactants in
    aerobic respiration; and
-   describe the similarities and differences between anaerobic and
    aerobic respiration.

### Course Information

Welcome to BIO101A: Introduction to Molecular and Cellular Biology.
General information about this course and its requirements can be found
below.  
  
 **Course Designers:** Liang Wang, Johanna Choo, [Ann
Schlosser](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-o-t/#ProfessorAnnSchlosser) and

 **Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  

-   Estrella Mountain Community College: Michael J. Farabee’s [*On-Line
    Biology
    Book*](http://www2.estrellamountain.edu/faculty/farabee/biobk/BioBookCELL2.html)
-   National Institutes of Health: Geoffrey Cooper et al.’s [*The
    Cell*](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9879/#A265)
-   YouTube: Saylor Foundation’s *[General Biology
    Lectures](http://www.youtube.com/user/saylorfoundation#g/c/EAA6B567A01FB397)*
-   National Institutes of Health: Harvey Lodish and Arnold Berk et
    al.’s [*Molecular Cell
    Biology*](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26883/#A203)

-   Professor John W. Kimball’s *[Biology
    Pages](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/BIO101-Carbohydrates.pdf)*
-   University of California, Davis’s *ChemWiki*: *[The Dynamic
    Chemistry Textbook](http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/)*

  
 **Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
must review the material from all units (1–8). You will also be required
to complete:  

-   Unit 1 Quiz
-   Subunit 2.8 Problem-Based Learning Assessment
-   Unit 2 Quiz
-   Unit 3 Quiz
-   Subunit 4.7 Problem-Based Learning Assessment
-   Unit 4 Quiz
-   Unit 5 Quiz
-   Unit 6 Quiz
-   Unit 7 Quiz
-   Unit 8 Quiz
-   Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the required assignments listed above.   
  
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the final exam.  
  
 Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you complete it. If
you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment: **Completing this course should take you a total of
**126 **hours****. Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on the subunits inside. These
should help you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a
look at these time advisories and determine how much time you have over
the next few weeks to complete each unit and then set goals for
yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take you about 7.75 hours. Perhaps
you can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete subunits 1.1
and 1.2 (a total of 1.25 hours) on Monday night, subunit 1.3 (a total of
5.5 hours) on Tuesday night, and so forth.
