**Unit 3: Cells** <span id="3"></span> 
*Modern cell theory states that the cell is the smallest unit of life.
In other words, the cell is the smallest thing that contains the
molecules we just learned about and is considered to be alive. Some
forms of life – like bacteria – consist of just one cell, while others –
like humans – are made up of trillions of cells. There are three main
types of cells: prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and plant cells. Each has its
own distinct characteristics. All bacteria, for example, are
prokaryotes, while most animal cells are eukaryotes. Scientists have
identified and studied many of these differences and, in the process,
learned how to design drugs (such as antibiotics) that will target only
prokaryotes in case of infection. (Note: If interested, you may choose
to study cell biology in greater detail in* [*BIO301: Cell
Biology*](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio301/)*.)*

    nerve cells are part of the cohort of membrane carriers and channels
    allowing materials to pass through the phospholipid bilayer.

**3.5.3 Types of Cell Signaling** <span id="3.5.3"></span>

    Communication”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnGXItWrJ3k) (YouTube)  
      
     Instructions: Watch this video to learn about the major types of
    cell-to-cell signaling. Cell-to-cell signaling is especially
    important in multicellular organisms, where the organism’s different
    cells are specialized for different functions. In order for the
    organism to function as a single unit, the cells in its body have to
    coordinate, a process made possible through various forms of cell
    signaling. Cell signaling is also important for immune cells. It
    allows them to distinguish self from foreign cells, thereby letting
    immune cells attack foreign cells (such as bacteria and viruses that
    invade the body).
