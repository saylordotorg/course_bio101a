**Unit 4: Photosynthesis** <span id="4"></span> 

*Photosynthesis is the ultimate source of energy for every living being
on earth, whether directly or indirectly. In middle school, you probably
learned about photosynthesis as a single reaction. You will now learn
that photosynthesis is actually a series of several different reactions
that convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose.* *[BIO306:
Botany](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio306/) goes into this subject in
more detail.*

**4.3 Cyclic Photophosphorylation** <span id="4.3"></span>

    Instructions: Read the “Light Reactions” section to understand how
    ATP is generated. The noncyclic photophosphorylation is the normal
    route by which the Calvin cycle obtains the high-energy molecules,
    ATP and NADPH, produced by the light reactions. However, the Calvin
    cycle consumes more ATP than NADPH. Therefore, plants need to use
    cyclic photophosphorylation, producing only ATP, to satisfy the
    needs of the Calvin cycle.  
      
     Reading this section and taking notes should take approximately 30
    minutes.

    Works”](http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0070960526/student_view0/chapter5/animation_quiz_1.html) (Flash)  
      
     Instructions: Go through this animation to learn about the Calvin
    cycle, and then take the quiz below the animation to gauge how well
    you have learned the material. The dark reactions or the Calvin
    cycles use the high-energy molecules generated by the light
    reactions to create bonds between carbon dioxide molecules to form
    sugar molecules (i.e., carbon fixation). These sugar-creating
    reactions are catalyzed by many enzymes, but the most important
    carbon fixing enzyme is RuBisCO, which is the world’s most abundant
    enzyme. Although the Calvin cycle is considered a light-independent
    reaction, it cannot occur without light. We can call it
    light-independent because, although it requires reactants produced
    from light-dependent reactions, the reaction itself does not
    directly involve light.  
      
     Watching this animation and answering the questions should take
    approximately 30 minutes.
