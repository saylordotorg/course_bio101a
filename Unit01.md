**Unit 1: Biology and Life** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit will provide you with some background information on what
biology has meant to people over time, from early Greek philosophers to
the scientists that laid the foundation for modern biology. We will also
discuss the characteristics that define life in an organism.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 13 hours.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.1: 0.25 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.2: 5.75 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.3: 6.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Assessment: 0.5 hours

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   explain why the classical Greek understanding of life was incorrect;
-   describe the scientific method; 
-   compare the contributions of early microbiologist Antonie van
    Leeuwenhoek with those of Louis Pasteur; 
-   describe the experiments that Gregor Mendel performed and how they
    led to our understanding of genetic inheritance;
-   identify the experiments that led to the discovery of the structure
    of DNA;
-   summarize the organization of life on Earth from the biosphere to
    the cells’ organelles; and
-   describe the roles of organs involved in homeostasis and metabolism.

    Evolution: The Grand Experiment, Book and Video
    Series”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNByRghR6sw) (YouTube)  
      
     Instructions: Watch this video, which will introduce the concept of
    spontaneous generation and show some experiments for and against its
    validity. The video describes how early scientists mistakenly
    thought life spontaneously appeared from nonliving things. The
    video’s underlying message also points out how the process of
    scientific discovery involves trial and error, allowing later,
    correct interpretations of the world to replace earlier, scientific
    misconceptions or errors.  
      
     Watching this video and taking notes should take approximately 15
