**Unit 2: Molecules, Macromolecules, and Polymers** <span
id="2"></span> 
*Molecules are the basic particles that make up both living and
nonliving things. They are comprised of atoms joined together in bonds.
Some molecules are quite small, such as water. Larger molecules are
called macromolecules and can be hundreds to thousands the size a water
molecule. Examples of macromolecules are nucleotides and amino acids.
When macromolecules are linked together, they become polymers. Examples
of polymers are lipids, complex carbohydrates, and proteins. Although it
may seem strange to think of it in this way, life at its most
fundamental level consists of a series of reactions involving these
molecules. For this reason, you must understand molecules and molecular
behavior in order to understand modern biology. (Note that you may opt
to study molecules in greater detail in [BIO401:
Biochemistry](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio401/).)*

-   **Reading: Wikipedia: “Nucleotides”**

    [“Nucleotides”](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Wiki-Nucleotides.png) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: This diagram shows the differences between
    nucleosides and nucleotides, ribonucleotides and
    deoxyribonucleotides, and the structures of the bases present in RNA
    and DNA.  
      
     A nucleoside is shown in yellow. A nucleoside is a simple sugar, or
    a monosaccharide, bonded to a base (in blue). We’ll get to what the
    bases are and their significance below. Nucleotides differ from
    nucleosides in that nucleosides are a nucleotide joined to one or
    more phosphate groups (in red). A nucleotide that is joined to one
    phosphate group would be called XMP (for the name of the
    base-monophosphate), a nucleotide that is joined to two phosphate
    groups would be called an XDP (for the name of the
    base-diphosphate), and a nucleotide that is joined to three
    phosphate groups would be called XTP (for the name of the
    base-triphosphate).  
      
     The sugar is a simple sugar, and if it has an –OH group at the 2’
    position (2’ is the number of the carbon in the sugar), the sugar is
    called ribose. When a ribose is bonded to a base, it is called
    ribonucleoside. When a ribonucleoside is joined to three phosphate
    groups, it becomes a ribonucleotide triphosphate. If the sugar has
    an –H at the 2’ position, the sugar is called deoxyribose. When a
    deoxyribose is bonded to a base, it is called deoxynucleoside. When
    a deoxynucleoside is joined to three phosphate groups, it becomes a
    deoxynucleotide triphosphate.  
      
     On the right side of the diagram, five bases are shown. RNA
    contains adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and uracil (U). DNA
    does not contain uracil; it contains thymine (T). Purines (A and G)
    contain two ring structures, and pyrimidines (C, U, T) contain one
    ring structure. An easier way to remember which bases are purines or
    pyrimidines is that purine is the shorter word, but more complex
    structure, while pyrimidine is the longer word but less complex
    structure.  
      

    Studying this diagram and taking notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.
