**Unit 6: Cellular Energy** <span id="6"></span> 

*Metabolism is the set of chemical reactions that enable living things
to produce the energy needed to maintain life. For plants, metabolism
refers to the process of creating glucose through photosynthesis. For
other organisms, however, metabolism means the conversion of food into
energy. It might help you to think of metabolism as digestion at the
molecular level, where the end product is ATP (which you learned about
earlier). Living things rely upon a steady source of ATP in order to
carry out all activities, from running after the bus to thinking about
math problems. This process starts with glycolysis, which converts
glucose to pyruvate. Pyruvate can then enter aerobic or anaerobic
respiration, depending on the situation. The end result is still ATP.
The biochemistry course
([BIO401](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio401/)) will present metabolic
reactions in greater detail.*

    (Flash)  
      
     Instructions: Watch this animation to understand how glycolysis
    works and then take the short quiz below the animation to see how
    well you have learned the subject. The word *glycolysis* literally
    means glucose breakdown. It is the name given to a series of
    reactions that ultimately breaks down the 6 carbon glucose molecule
    into two 3 carbon molecules of pyruvate and releases ATP as energy
    in the process. But do note that while there is a net gain of ATP in
    glycolysis, some reaction steps actually use up ATP.   
      
     Watching this animation should take approximately 15 minutes.

    Yields”](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/BIO101A-6.2.3-CellularRespiration.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read the “Efficiency of ATP Production” section.
    Understand when (i.e., during which stages) ATP is produced. Both
    plants and animals use a similar proton-driven pump to produce ATP.
    This pump literally forces ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic
    phosphate together. Note that aerobic respiration produces much more
    ATP than does anaerobic respiration.

    Link: Pearson Education: [“Alcoholic
    Fermentation”](http://www.phschool.com/science/biology_place/biocoach/cellresp/review5b.html) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Watch the four animations to understand how ethanol
    (alcohol) is produced. Click on “Animate 1,” “Animate 2,” “Animate
    3,” and “Animate 4” to view the steps of fermentation. Thanks to
    alcoholic fermentation, we can enjoy beer, wine, and other alcoholic
    beverages! Anaerobic respiration does not require the presence of
    oxygen because it uses other molecules as electron acceptors for
    electrons from high-energy NADH molecules.  
      
     Watching these four animations should take approximately 30
    minutes.

    Fermentation”](http://www.phschool.com/science/biology_place/biocoach/cellresp/review5a.html) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Watch the four animations to understand how lactic
    acid is generated (you will notice it is similar to how ethanol is
    created). When our bodies do not have enough oxygen to generate ATP,
    or when we need more ATP than aerobic respiration is providing us
    with, lactate fermentation steps up and enables us to produce the
    ATP we need. Students should also compare the reactions of anaerobic
    and aerobic metabolism to understand why the latter is more
    efficient at producing energy-rich molecules necessary for life.
    This difference also explains why most life forms on Earth utilize
    aerobic metabolism.  
      
     Watching these four animations should take approximately 30
    minutes.
